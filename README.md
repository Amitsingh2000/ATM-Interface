## Introduction

We have all come across ATMs in our cities, and this project simulates the functionalities of an ATM using Java. The system prompts the user to enter their user ID and user PIN. Upon successful authentication, the ATM functionalities are unlocked, allowing the user to perform various operations such as Transactions History, Withdraw, Deposit, Transfer, and Quit.

## Getting Started

To get started with the ATM Console Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Amitsingh2000/ATM-Interface`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd atm-console`
3. Compile the Java classes: `javac *.java`
4. Run the application: `java Main`

## Features

### Transactions History

The Transactions History feature allows users to view their transaction history, providing details of the transactions they have made in the past.

### Withdraw

With the Withdraw feature, users can withdraw funds from their account. They need to specify the amount they wish to withdraw, and the system will handle the transaction accordingly.

### Deposit

The Deposit feature allows users to deposit funds into their account. Users can specify the amount they want to deposit, and the funds will be added to their account balance.

### Transfer

With the Transfer feature, users can transfer funds from their account to another account within the ATM's system. The user needs to provide the recipient's account number and the amount to be transferred.

### Quit

The Quit feature allows users to exit the ATM Console Application gracefully.

## Usage

2. Upon successful authentication, the user gains access to the main menu, where they can choose from the available options: Transactions History, Withdraw, Deposit, Transfer, and Quit.
3. The user can select the desired operation by entering the corresponding option number.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the chosen operation.
